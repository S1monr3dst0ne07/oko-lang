# oko-lang – A programming language
**oko-lang** (or simply **oko**) is an interpreted, non-esoteric programming language the official implementation of which is powered by the Deno JS runtime. Features most of the things that you can find in other languages - variables, complex data structures, functions, program flow control, loops, rich standart library (built-ins) and more.

## ⚠️ Warning
At the moment, oko-lang is in its early stage of development. Expect ground-breaking changes, no backward compatability, significant performance and development experience improvements and much more. If you would like to contribute to the language by any means, [we have a discord server.](https://discord.gg/NSK7YJ2R6j) There you can contact me - the main developer - and other people who are willing to help us build **oko**.

_(The rest of the README is currently being written - even as you read this text ...)_
