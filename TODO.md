# âœ… TODO for `oko-lang`
This file is a todo list for the `oko` programming language. Things that are listed here are being developed at the moment or will be in the near future.

- [ ] Rewriting the whole language into **C**. This will give the language more performance, stability, would possibly allow for possible compiler development in the future and much more. Also the hype train will come and pick up the language (last one was a local joke).
